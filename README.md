# sourcemanv1

In case anyone is curious about it, this is demo code of my part 1 story developing [sourceman editor](sourcemaneditor.com)

It is almost a total failure (emotionally damaging myself), lol. 

This repo only contains some demo code, and a lot of editor functionalities are not included (e.g. one can't even delete any character)...

If you want to run it locally to take a look, first resolve dependencies by running:
```
flutter pub get
```

The docs folder contains a built version, and it is also the version showing on my medium story, so that I can host everything together but separately.
